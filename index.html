     <p>What is visual studio? 
        Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps.

    <p>What is Console? Web developers often log messages to the Console to make sure that their JavaScript is working as expected. To log a message, you insert an expression like console.log('Hello, Console!') into your JavaScript. When the browser executes your JavaScript and sees an expression like that, it knows that it's supposed to log the message to the Console.
        The Console is also a REPL. You can run JavaScript in the Console to interact with the page that you're inspecting.
        Modifying the page from the Console is possible because the Console has full access to the page's window. DevTools has a few convenience functions that make it easier to inspect a page. For example, suppose that your JavaScript contains a function called hideModal. Running debug(hideModal) pauses your code on the first line of hideModal the next time that it's called. See Console Utilities API Reference to see the full list of utility functions.

When you run JavaScript you don't have to interact with the page. You can use the Console to try out new code that's not related to the page. For example, suppose you just learned about the built-in JavaScript Array method map(), and you want to experiment with it. The Console is a good place to try out the function.
